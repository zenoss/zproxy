#
# To artifact-ize this project, we elected to leave the legacy build log defined in
# GNUmakefile/zenmagic.mk and creat this makefile to make the necessary docker
# invocation to run the old make
#
# The targets for this makefile are:
#
# clean - removes all intermediate and final build artifacts
# build - downloads and builds the constituent parts of zproxy
# install - stages the runtime distribution of files in the 'install' subdirectory
# package - creates a tar ball from the contents of the install subdirectory
#
